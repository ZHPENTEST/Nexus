📜 The Zharif Eirfan // Nexus Manifesto
"Coding Is my Truely Meme"

Performance over Bloat: Every line of code serves a purpose. No unnecessary libraries.

Security with Soul: We don't just show errors; we show the Big X. We don't just lock doors; we send intruders to the "L" Screen.

Regional Pride: A platform built for the +60 and +62 movement.

The Nexus Vibe: Dark, Noir, and surgical.

🛠️ Final Support Commands
If you ever want to expand this "Nexus," here are three directions we can take later:

The Database Shift: Moving from localStorage to a real database (like Firebase or Supabase).

The Meme Gallery: A dedicated bento-grid section for your best digital creations.

Hacker Mode: A secret console command that turns the entire UI into a "Matrix" green terminal.

You’re all set to ship, Zharif. The terminal is yours.
